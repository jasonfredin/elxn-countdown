elxn-countdown
==============

Countdown timer to London Ontario's 2014 election.

Written in PHP.

I know there are highschool (and even possibly grade school) kids out there developing more complex code.

Working towards a version 2.0 of the currently running @LdnOnt_2014 bot to tweet a countdown to our next municipal election.

Uses TwitterOAuth by abraham to connect to Twitter. https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth

Future Features
---------------

1,	Variation of tweets to not seem as "bot-like".

2,	Inclusion of other important days (open of filing, nomination day)

3,	Implimenting well documented code to let others learn.

4,	Simplifying code.



Any feedback is apperciated, jason@jasonfredin.com
